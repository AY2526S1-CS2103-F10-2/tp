# PropertyPal

*This is a project for CS2103 Software Engineering (SE) students, designed around a realistic use case in the real estate industry.*

---

## Overview

PropertyPal is a **desktop application** that helps **real estate agents** manage their client information and preferences efficiently. It is built to demonstrate key **software engineering principles** such as modularity, object-oriented design, testability, and documentation.

The project simulates an ongoing software development effort for a mid-sized application (~6 KLoC), providing students with hands-on experience extending, testing, and maintaining an evolving codebase.

---

## Purpose

PropertyPal acts as a **personal assistant for property agents**, offering tools to **store**, **search**, and **organize** client information — such as names, contact details, preferred areas, and property types — all in one place.

### Key Goals:
- Simplify the process of managing client data and preferences
- Support **quick and reliable search** by name, tag, location, or property type
- Help agents **segment and prioritize** clients for personalized outreach
- Offer **fast data entry** and a **clear, accessible interface** for everyday use

---

## Features

PropertyPal enables real estate agents to:
- **Add, edit, and delete** client records
- **Search and filter** clients using various fields (name, address, phone, tags)
- **Organize** clients by location or property type for targeted follow-ups
- **Visualize client distribution** and identify high-demand areas (planned feature)
- **Maintain readable, well-structured records**, supporting both novice and experienced agents

---

## Design & Structure

- Written in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** style
- Built with a **focus on clarity and extensibility**
- Designed as a **mid-sized teaching codebase** (~6 KLoC), ideal for SE students learning about:
    - Abstraction and encapsulation
    - Layered architecture
    - Automated testing
    - Incremental feature extension

---

## Target Users

PropertyPal is tailored for:
- **Experienced property agents** who want a centralized place to manage clients and leads
- **New agents** looking for a simple, intuitive system to track buyers and sellers
- **Niche specialists** focusing on specific areas or property types, who need targeted filtering tools

---

<!--
## Learning Focus

For SE students, PropertyPal serves as a **practical learning resource** that:
- Demonstrates **domain-driven feature design**
- Encourages **clean coding and refactoring practices**
- Provides **testable modules** for integration and unit testing
- Allows experimentation with **new features** (e.g., maps, analytics, tag management)

## Documentation

For detailed setup instructions, feature descriptions, and design explanations, see the [**PropertyPal Product Guide**](https://ay2526s1-cs2103-f10-2.github.io/tp/index.html).

---

<!--
## Contributing

Students and developers are welcome to **extend PropertyPal** with new capabilities, such as:
- Enhanced **filtering or search logic**
- **Interactive map views**
- **Data analytics** for client insights
- **Improved tag management**

Each contribution should follow **good SE practices**, including code quality, testing, and clear documentation.
