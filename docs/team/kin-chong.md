### Project: PropertyPal

PropertyPal is a desktop application that helps real estate agents manage their client information efficiently.
It was developed as part of the team project for the National University of Singapore CS2103 course. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project:
* **`find` command**
  * Changed `find` command to support prefix-based searches.
  * Enhancement of the find command to support exact price matching and normalization of price formats.
  * Implementation of price parsing, validation, and normalization logic (e.g., removing currency symbols, enforcing numeric formats).
  * Refactoring of the PersonContainsKeywordsPredicate class to integrate price-based search predicates and additional defensive programming checks.
<br>
<br>
* **Contributions to the User Guide**
  * Updated and cleaned up the User Guide, removing outdated mentions of tags and revising the find section to include new price-based search behavior
  * Improved clarity of examples, consistent parameter formatting, and error message explanations.
<br>
<br>
* **Contributions to the Developer Guide**
    * Updated UML class to update `Person` with new fields of intention, property type and price.
    * Explained the rationale behind `OR` search in the `find` command.
<br>
<br>
* **Team contributions**
    * Participated in PR reviews and merges.
    * Provided code review feedback for teammates' features.
<br>
<br>
* **Project management**
    * Facilitated and led group discussions.
    * Coordinated merges and issues creation between group members in the repository.
