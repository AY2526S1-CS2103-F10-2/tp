PropertyPal is a **desktop application** that helps **real estate agents** manage their client information and preferences efficiently. It is built to demonstrate key **software engineering principles** such as modularity, object-oriented design, testability, and documentation.

The project simulates an ongoing software development effort for a mid-sized application (~6 KLoC), providing students with hands-on experience extending, testing, and maintaining an evolving codebase.

* If you are interested in using PropertyPal, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing PropertyPal, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
